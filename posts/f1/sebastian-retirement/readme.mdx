```
I hereby announce my retirement form formula one by the end of the 2022 season
  ^ 特地，在此

Probably I should start with a long list of people to thank now

but I feel it is more important to explain the resons behind my decision
                                                      ^ 在...背后

I love this sport. It has been central to my life sine I can remember
                               ^ 中心的 adj

But as much as there is life on track, there is my life off track too
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^但是不仅

Being a racing driver has never been my sole identity
                                        ^ 唯一的

I very much believe in identity by who we are and how we treat others rather than what we do

Who am I? I am Sebastian, father of three children and husband to a wonderful woman

I am curious and easily fascinated by passionate or skilled people
     ^ 好奇的，求知的    ^ 感到着谜的 adj

I am obsessed with perfection
     ^ 痴迷的 === fascinated

I am tolerant and feel we all have the same rights to live,
     ^ 宽容的

no matter what we look like, where we come from and who we love

I love being outside and love nature and its wonders
                                             ^ 奇迹

I am stubborn and impatient
     ^ 固执的，执拗的

I can be really annoying
                ^ 惹人烦的

I like chocolate and the smell of fresh bread

My favourite color is blue

I believe in change and progress and that every little bit makes a difference

I am an optimist and I believe people are good
        ^ /ˈɑptɪmɪst/

Next to racing， I have grown a family and I love being around them

I have grown other interests outside Formula One

My passion for racing an Formula One comes with lots of time spent away from them(family?) and takes a lot of energy

Committing to passion the way I did and the way I think it is right,
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 表示承诺会去做某事，并持续投入 === promise + dedicate

does no longer go side by side with my wish to be a great father and husband
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 与**并行，与**并肩

The energy it takes to become one with the car and the team, to chase perfection takes focus and commitment
                                                                                                 ^ 投入、专注

My goals have shifted from winning races and fighting for championships
              ^ 转变

to seeing my children grow, passing on my values, helping them up when they fall
                                                                            ^ 跌倒

listening to them when they need me, not having to say goodbye,

and most important, being able to learn from them and let them inspire me

Children are our future

Further(此外) I feel there is so much to explore and learn about life and about myself
^ adv:更进一步 adj:更进一步的

Speaking of the future, I feel we live very decisive times(时代)
                                            ^ 决定性的
And how we all shape these next years will determine our lives
               ^ 塑造                      ^ 决定

My passion comes with certain(某些) aspects(方面) that I have learned to dislike
                      ^ 确定的 / 确信的;  某个 / 某些
They might be solved in the future

but they will to apply that change has to grow much much stronger and has to be leading to action today
但要真正应用这一变革，就必须更加强大，并且必须立即付诸行动。

Talk is not enough and we can not afford to wait
                                  ^ (承担得起，比如买得起，给予，这些都能表示承担得起的意思)

There is no alternative. The race is underway
            ^ 选择                   ^ 开始了、进行了 === in progress

My best race? Still to come. I believe in moving forwards and moving on
                                                 ^ 向前 对比 towards ：表示朝什么方向不一定是向前，可以是任何方向

Time is a one-way street and I want to go with the times
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 单行道

Looking back is only going to slow you down

I look forward to race down unknown track and I will be finding new challenges

The marks I left on track will stay until time and rain will wash them away(离去)

New ones will be put down
                 ^^^^^^^^ 留下

Tomorrow belongs to those shaping today
明天属于那些塑造今天的人

The next corner is in good hands as the new generation has already turned in
新一代已经转向，下一个弯道已掌握在自己手中

I believe there is still a race to win

Farewell and thanks for letting me share the track with you. I loved every bit of it
^ 再回，再见 书面用于
